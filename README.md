## Installation

To simplify installation we have decided to use `Makefile`. It is a good ol' tool that can define dependencies graphs easily. So if you want to install dependencies you have to create your own dependencies and requirements

```
make install_osx
```

## Dataset

The datasest must be stored inside the ./data/ directory.
